    <h1>Form Container Demo</h1>

    <!-- Form element is the container -->
    <form>
        <!-- label and input fields are the children -->
        <label>Username</label>
        <input />
        <label>Password</label>
        <input />
    </form>

</html>

<!-- when working with the idea of container our parent is the container that holds the DIRECT children.  

parent
<div>
    <h2>Some heading</h2> child of parent
    <div> child of parent
        <h3>Some other heading</h3> this h3 is a child of its containing div. The containing div is then the parent. 
        the outer most div would be the grandparent. Flex and Grid (when we get to them) only target direct children. 
        More on that wednesday.
